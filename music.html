    <h3 class="info-heading" id="i1">Performances</h3>
    <p class="info" id="i1">
      I am a percussionist performing in two a cappella groups in the greater
      Boston area:<br>
      <br>
      Pitch Slapped <em>(Berklee)</em><br>
      The Unisons <em>(Northeastern)</em><br>
      <br>
      It's an honor to be able to rehearse and perform with both of these
      wonderful groups, and I've learned so much from my time making music with
      them.<br>
      <br>
      I plan to continue performing my music live for as long as possible, while
      recording tracks in the mean time.<br>
    </p>
    <h3 class="info-heading" id="i2">Arrangements</h3>
    <p class="info" id="i2">
      I create arrangements of funk and r&b music. I use vocals in the style
      of contemporary a cappella in my arrangements, as well as techniques from
      solo beatboxing to emphasize moments and flesh out the sound of a song.<br>
      <br>
      You can find my arrangements on...<br>
      <br>
      Instagram, YouTube, and (coming soon)
      Spotify.
    </p>
    <h3 class="info-heading" id="i3">Recordings</h3>
    <p class="info" id="i3">
      I record all of my arrangement productions myself. I use a combination of
      Ableton Live, DaVinci Resolve, Blender, and Inkscape for audiovisual
      production. I am self-taught in all of these programs, and I'm more than
      happy to share my process if asked.<br>
      <br>
      If you are a videographer, editor, or artist and you like my work, please
      reach out! I am very open to collaborating to create visuals for my music.
    </p>
    <h3 class="info-heading" id="i4">Lessons</h3>
    <p class="info" id="i4">
      I have taught several people one-on-one over the years, and I have held
      lessons and a masterclass at Boston Sings (BOSS) 2025.<br>
      <br>
      If you are interested in learning more about vocal percussion technique,
      arrangment, production, or developing your own style, pelase fill out my
      lesson form! I try to keep rates low so lessons are more accessible, since I
      really love sharing this knowledge.<br>
      <br>
      See you soon (hopefully)!
