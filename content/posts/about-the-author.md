## Who am I?

My name is Melody, and I use [she/her](https://en.pronouns.page/@Mixolydian) pronouns. Pleased to know you're here!

## What do I do?

I have two great passions in life: computing and music.

In terms of the former, I've been programming as a hobby for over a decade, and
even have some professional experience under my belt! Throughout my hobby
programming I've concentrated mostly on games, and especially within the last
four-or-so years on computer graphics and rendering technology. Game engine
development fascinates me, but visual effects work with shaders and low-level
graphics tech is my real specialty.

Aside from my adventures in computing, I make a lot of music, most of it
unfortunately unpublished in any official capacity. I perform live with two a
capella groups, [Pitch Slapped](https://www.pitchslappedacappella.biz/album)
and [The Unisons](https://neunisons.com/music-releases). I also produce music
of many varieties, since I really wanted to just throw away all of my free
time.

## What's this website doing with this style?

Glad you asked! This site uses [a hugo theme](https://github.com/loikein/hugo-tufte) inspired by [tufte-css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/). To quote the latter,

> Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated
> by Edward Tufte’s books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its
> simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with
> text, and carefully chosen typography.
